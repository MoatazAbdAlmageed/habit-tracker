![challenge_habits_tracker](challenge_habit.png)
I am really into habit trackers and I am currently using various tools to track different parts of my life.

- Momentium iphone app - which is common habit tracking technique called "a don't break the streak"

- Goal Tracker - I use Evernote to track my monthly goals and yearly goals. 

I want a easy way to coorlate my tracking into one simple to use interface. Also the advantage of building my own tool I can add features or change it to whatever I like.
